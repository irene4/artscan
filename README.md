Art Scan idea: An image processor targeted at traditional artists that will provide presets and tools to make art look professionally scanned without the use of a scanner.
<br /><br />
How: Automate routines that an artist would go through in an image processor to enhance a photo of a drawing.
Combination of a scanner app, a simple image editor, and filter presets.
